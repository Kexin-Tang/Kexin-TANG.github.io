People always combine HEXO with GitHub to bulid their own blogs or webpages.\nInstallFirst of all, you need to install node.js, you can refer to its website here, and git, you can refer here.\nAfter configuration, you are supposed to install HEXO via node.js command called npm.\nnpm install -g hexo-cli\n\nInitializeOnce HEXO is installed, run the following commands to initialize HEXO in the target &lt;folder&gt;.\nhexo init &lt;folder&gt;  # initcd &lt;folder&gt;npm install         # install other dependency\n\nOnce initialized, here’s what your project folder will look like:\n.├── _config.yml         # user can config settings here├── package.json        # record dependency etc.├── scaffolds           # define three post methods -- post, draft and page├── source              # store your posts and other resources|   ├── _drafts|   └── _posts└── themes              # user&#39;s custom themes\n\nConfigurationIn _config.yml file, you can stylize your own settings. For example:\n\ntitle – your website’s name\nurl – the URL of your website\n\nyou can find more details here.\nCommandnewhexo new [layout] [-p/--path filePath] &lt;title&gt;\n\nCreates a new article. If no [layout] is provided, Hexo will use the default_layout from _config.yml. \nBy default, Hexo will use the title to define the path of the file. For page, it will create a directory of that name and an index.md file in it. Use the –path option to override that behaviour and define the file path:\nhexo new page --path about/me &quot;About&quot;\nwill create source/about/me.md file with the title “About” set in the front matter.\nFor post, it will automatically generate a new file in source/_posts/&lt;title&gt;.md\nserverhexo serverhexo s\nRun a local server.\ngeneratehexo g\nGenerate static files, which means it will convert/render .md or .ejs files to html files.\ncleanhexo clean\n\nCleans the cache file (db.json) and generated files (public).\ndeployhexo d\n\nDeploy your files to remote server. You can set your deploy destination:\n\nopen _config.yml\nconfigure depoly area, for example, if you want to deploy your website in GitHubdeploy:    type: git    repository: https://github.com/xxx/xxx.github.io.git    branch: master\n\n","categories":["Web","HEXO","Framework","HEXO"],"tags":["hexo","web","framework"]},{"title":"How-to-write-hello-world-in-HEXO-II","url":"/2021/04/19/How-to-write-hello-world-in-HEXO-II/","content":"Post your fileNow, you can begin to write your markdown or ejs files.
